Overview
--------

The FSP task is an eye-tracking task to test social orienting and decreased social motivation
with regards to gaze. Each trial in this gaze-contingent task begins with a ``100*100px`` ball
animation. Once gaze is within the ball’s interest area (IA), two still images of faces (or a
in one condition a toy) are displayed oriented away from screen center (as shown in :numref:`FSP-image` )
The images and the resulting video are sized to ``533*533px``and are displayed centrally within
the left or right half of the screen (an eccentricity from center of ``480px``).

Conditions
----------

Away vs Towards (AT)
    Videos of caregivers facing away vs towards
Invariant vs Variant (IV)
    Videos of caregivers saying “hello”/”good job” (variant)
    vs smiles (invariant).
Face vs Toy
    Shown videos of a caregiver's faces vs videos of
    toys. 


Interest Areas
--------------

There are  three interest areas regions for the experiment. The ``250px`` ellipse 
surrounding the ball and the left and right rectangular ``600*600px`` regions around 
each image/video.  The name of each interest area changes based on behavior, e.g. 
if the right video is a ‘variant’ stimuli and the right variant side is triggered to 
play, the IA for that side is labelled “Variant_Video_IA” and the non-video side is 
labeled ``Invariant_Still_IA``. This labelling is to make clear which IA side and 
condition was showing video, and which was a still image. This labelling could aid 
analysis and dwell time measures.

Gaze Triggers
-------------

Each trial begins with the ball animation which rotates until gaze is detected to the ball
IA region by an invisible boundary (IB) trigger. This trigger has a minimum duration set to
``100ms``. Gaze must be continuously within the ball IA region for ``100ms`` for the trigger
to fire. Once this trigger fires, the stimuli as still images are shown (:numref:`FSP-image`).
For trials that do not have a fixed choice video side, there are IB triggers that will fire
if gaze is held within the still image IA for ``100ms`` (minimum duration). The triggered 
side will then show the corresponding video (after a prespecified delay). 

Classifiers
-----------
There is no built-in classifier for this task as the interest area analysis and eye movement or
behavior of interest to the videos will need to be deduced/coded after data collection. There is,
however, clear labelling of which side was triggered by gaze. There is also an initial look RT 
measure which provides an RT value for the first sample of gaze detected to the still image that
triggers the video (after ``100ms``).

Animations
----------
The only animation is the ``100*100px`` ball which rotates clockwise at 1Hz.  

Event Messaging
---------------
Each trial begins with the message ``BALL_ANIMATION_ONSET`` and is followed by 
``GAZE_TRIGGER_TO_BALL`` when gaze triggers the IB, or after ``2500ms`` without
a gaze trigger the message ``TIMEOUT_FALSE_START`` is written. Following the 
gaze-trigger the message ``STILL_IMAGE_ONSET`` signifies the onset of the still 
images. Gaze triggering the left video writes the message ``GAZE_TRIGGER_LEFT``,
and the right trigger ``GAZE_TRIGGER_RIGHT``. If the video presentation side is 
fixed by the data source, the message ``FIXED_SIDE`` is written. Once the video 
begins, there is a message for each frame of the video, e.g.  ‘RIGHT VIDEO FRAME 1’
with a numeric value showing the currently displayed frame. This was included to
allow a simpler frame level interest area values to be matched up if required. If
not gaze triggers a stimulus within ``5000ms`` ``TIMEOUT_NO_GAZE`` is written and
the trial is recycled. The trial ends with the message ``DISPLAY_BLANK`` when the
final blank screen is displayed.
